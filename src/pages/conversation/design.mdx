# Plan for Your Bot
Now that you understand more about bots and conversation, it’s time to start preparing for the actual building. Using the concepts form the learning phase, you will be developing a plan BEFORE sitting down in your tooling to write content.

Justify a bot as the solution
Always remember that bots aren't an instant solution to problems facing your business or brand. The reasoning behind using a bot as a solution shouldn’t be just because the technology exists. The reasoning must be based on the real value natural conversation would bring to your users and brand. Implementing conversation has it's highest value when there is a need for engaging, contextual interaction, or a bot can accomplish something faster than traditional means.

Before choosing a bot as a solution, ask yourself these questions.

 - What is the user's goal?
 - How in-depth is the assistance the user will need?
 - Is your domain something that is better off left in the hands of human assistance?
 - How is a bot superior to "x" (i.e. online documentation, contextual support, wizards, etc...)?
 - What kind of data sources or abilities can this bot leverage for your business and your users?

Establish your bot's purpose
First and foremost, you must establish the purpose for your bot. This will be the basis of all of your conversational content and functionality. Start by justifying conversation as a solution.

 - Understand why you would choose conversation over other options
 - Determine the specific value a bot will bring
 = Understand what your users want/expect from a bot

Narrowing your intent helps focus your work and accomplish a manageable number of tasks with higher quality. The probability of success is best correlated with how focused your bot is. Having a clear understanding of the focus also helps you communicate what exactly your bot can do so you avoid unrealistic expectations of the bot.

#### EXAMPLE
Let’s say one of your clients is a bank named Big Blue Bank. The bank has expressed interest in some sort of virtual agent that they can interact with when the bank is closed. This is not just for online banking, but to make users feel the same personal trust and connection they feel when speaking with a bank teller. Your bot’s purpose would be to provide a trustworthy, personable bot that assists Big Blue Bank customers with any banking or customer service needs at any hour.

# Do Your Research

In order for a bot to understand its users, it must be provided with examples of how users make specific requests, questions or utterances. Observe examples of real conversations that relate to your bot’s subject matter. Listen to recorded phone conversations or written transcripts if they’re available. Ask yourself, “What are the participants trying to accomplish with their conversation?”

#### Observation techniques
Simulation - One way to gather example conversation is by simulating a bot, and putting real people “behind the wheel,” with a smaller representative sample of users. Save and review the interaction logs to identify intents, topics and utterances of your users.

Quick bot - Another way is to quickly build an extremely limited, narrow-focus bot, using your own examples of what you expect users to say, and deploying the bot in the channel(s) it will be used in to start gathering real user data.

Question collection - The sources for data (e.g. questions) most commonly asked by end- users, customer chat logs , business processes , documentation , social media (Twitter) , etc.

#### EXAMPLE
To build your Big Blue Bank bot, you will need to see how exactly bankers and employees at Big Blue Bank interact with their users. You can study phone log interactions or online communications. The goal of your research should be to understand what makes the difference in these interactions when interacting with a human. What kind of language do the humans use? What do they talk about? How personable are they?

# List Your Topics
Topics provide context. They are the high-level subjects of a conversation at a given point. A way to think about topics is through the concept of "Minimum Viable Knowledge" or MVK. This is the minimum set of topics your bot will need to be able to discuss in order to be successful and fulfill its purpose. If you have those, then you set your bot up with a strong foundation.

As an activity, list out all the possible topics you can think of for your bot, then prioritize.

#### EXAMPLE
After doing your research and deciding your bot's purpose it should start to become to clear what your topics will be. These are the subjects of the conversation. For Big Blue Bank, these could be some starter topics for an MVK.

 - Opening a new account
 - Money transfers
 - Deposits
 - Withdrawals
 - Loans
 - Basic Self-serve Customer Service

# Think About Exchanges

There will be exchanges that will need to be covered within your topics. These will be where the actual turn-taking and conversing is taking place. Your topic is the subject of conversation at any given time, while the exchanges are the sub-topics that are covered in conversation.

How you divide up your topics and exchanges are up to you, but what’s most important is that you are mapping out this informationahead of time. It will help you organize your bot's knowledge.

Here are some archetypal examples of exchanges are present in most conversation.

 - Greeting - Greeting
 - Question - Answer
 - Request - Permit / Refusal / Challenge / Put off
 - Command - Compliance / Refusal
 - Blame/ accusation - Admission / Denial
 - Offer - Acceptance / Refusal
 - Invitation - Acceptance / Declination
 - Complaint - Denial / Apology / Excuse / Justification / Challenge
 - Assertion - Agreement / Disagreement
 - Acknowledgment - Acknowledgment
 - Summons - Answer
 - Compliment - Acceptance / Rejection / Agreement / Shift / Return
 - Farewell - Farewell

EXAMPLE
Your exchanges will be directly related to your topics. They will help you start to consider what kinds of interactions you may have with your users.

Opening a new account
 - Application processes
 - Asking for information on accounts

Money transfers
 - Transferring between personal accounts
 - Transferring to external accounts

Deposits
 - Depositing from a check
 - Depositing cash
 - Information on deposits

Withdrawals
 - How to withdrawal
 - Withdrawal help

Loans
 - Info on loans
 - Starting a loan

Customer Service
 - Receiving feedback
 - Assisting with problems/complaints


# Design Your Bot's Personality

This step comes later in the process because without all of the proper planning you have done up to this point you will be ill- prepared to identify the proper personality for your bot. Since a bot’s personality will be the "being" that the user will interact with in the end product, it needs to properly reflect the conversational tendencies of its particular domain.

Humans mostly want to connect with each other, not technology. That’s why we have the tendency to anthropomorphize everything, from our cars to our devices. If you don't establish a personality for your bot, your users will still give it one.

You will need to establish a personality that best communicates your bot's purpose and represent's your brands values. By understanding how your personality would act and speak in a situation, you can write your conversation through their imaginary voice.

Ask yourselves these questions when developing your bot's personality:

 - How social is it?
 - How open and up front is it?
 - How agreeable is it?
 - How thoughtful is it?
 - How moody is it?
 - How excitable is it?
 - How professional is it?
 - What kind of character is it?
 - How would it react in negative or hostile situation?
 - What medium will it utilize?
 - What is it not like?

There are lots of different ways to come up with a personality, and all of them are correct. You might consider thinking about personality mapping techniques includingthe Caliper Profile, orThe Myers & Briggs Type Indicator. There is no set method.

#### EXAMPLE
For Big Blue Bank, you may consider striking a balance between an official tone and a friendly, trusting tone. Look at the most successful banking employees with great relationships with their customers. How do they act? In what situations do they joke around, and in what situations are they serious?

# Planning Your Intents and Entities
If you take the time to consider your intents and entities now, it will make building your bot that much easier. How you craft your intents and entities is informed by what you want your bot to do, and how expressive you want it to be. The true bridge between your plan and your tooling lies in your intents and entities. To illustrate this point, basic Watson Conversation screens will be displayed but many conversation engines behave similarly.

Intents = The action or purpose behind an utterance.

Teach your bot to recognize intents by providing different examples of user utterances order that communicate an action or purpose. Based on the examples you provide, the bot is able to understand other examples of the same intent that you did not provide. It's important to have variation in the provided examples. For example, to teach your bot to understand the intent of #order, you could provide the following examples:

 - “I’d like to order some tacos and beer”
 - “I want to order some food”
 - “I’d like a taco, please”
 - “Gimme food”

Entities = An object that was mentioned in the utterance that is relevant to the user’s purpose.

To create an entity you must provide an entity name and entity values. You can also provide synonyms if required (which are other ways your users refer to those value).

For example, in the utterance: “I’d like to order some tacos and beer”.

Entity name: Food

food = tacos, pizza, pie, hamburger, burger, etc

drink = beer, brew, suds, soda, pop, wine, vino, water, etc.

Proper utilization of intents and entities is essential in making sure your bot can carry out its purpose.
