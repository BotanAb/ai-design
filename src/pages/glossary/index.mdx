## Aa

#### artificial intelligence (AI)
A system capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes. Note that AI is a broad field of science that covers many sub-disciplines, including machine learning, visual recognition, and natural language processing.

_The acronym AI is widely understood to refer to artificial intelligence, so do not use this same acronym to refer to [augmented intelligence](#)._

#### assistant
An AI-driven agent with domain knowledge that assists a human user with a task. Assistants may take the form of a chatbot or some other interface.

#### augmented intelligence
A similar term to artificial intelligence but with more of a focus on AI's assistive role, emphasizing the fact that cognitive technology is designed to enhance human intelligence rather than replace it.

## Cc

#### confidence score
In AI contexts, the predicted probability of an answer being correct. This is often a numerical expression of certainty shown as a percentage.

## Ee

#### entity
In AI contexts, a representation of a real-world object (such as a person, location, or bank account), used by a machine learning model. For example, in the chatbot utterance: "I’d like to order some tacos and beer", the entities would be tacos (food) and beer (drink). Typically, entities are nouns.

## Ii

#### insight
In AI contexts, an observation that a machine learning model makes about patterns or unique outliers in a set of data. This can be used, for example, to provide current snapshots and predictions of customer behaviors and attitudes.

#### intent
1) Broadly, the goals, wants, needs, and values of users and businesses. Intent provides your solution’s purpose.
2) In AI contexts, when a chatbot interprets a conversation, it identifies the action or purpose behind a user's utterance (usually expressed by the verbs). These are identified as the intents. For example, in the utterance: "Where is the bathroom", the intent is to find a location.

## Mm

#### machine learning (ML)
A subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (that is, to progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

#### model / ML model
In machine learning contexts, a method for performing a function or making a decision by running data through a series of mathematical steps, i.e. algorithms. The model represents the steps an intelligent machine will take to arrive at a decision.

## Tt

#### training
In AI contexts, the process of building a model through learning from a data set. Humans teach machine learning models to identify entities and intents in data by showing them examples and correcting the computer's responses until they identify things with an acceptable degree of accuracy.

## Ww

#### Watson Machine Learning
An IBM Cloud service that is available through IBM Watson Studio, which uses trusted data to put machine learning and deep learning models into production. It leverages an automated, collaborative workflow to grow intelligent business applications easily and with more confidence.
