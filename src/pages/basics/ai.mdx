  These are technical guides for non-technical people. Whether you’ve found yourself in need of knowing AI or have always been curious to learn more, this will teach you enough to dive deeper into the vast and deep AI ocean.

  Inspired by Reddit’s “Explain Like I’m 5,” these succinctly break down complicated topics without relying on technical jargon.

# What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a system capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes.

Science fiction has done a fantastic job at warning us what's to come when machines are able to think on par with humans. Fortunately, the AI often depicted in movies is far more advanced than what technology is capable of any time soon. We call a system that can perform any and all functions a human being can an artificial general intelligence (AGI). 

While these systems are far off, there's a lot of deserved buzz around artificial narrow intelligence, or weak AI, which focuses on one, narrow task. Within narrow AI, there are two branches: rule-based AI and statistical based AI. The former involves hard coding all potential possibilities, while the latter uses algorithms that can grow and change over time without human intervention.

#### Human vs. machine intelligence

When we're born, most of us are prewired to learn. Much of what we learn over time can be broken out into specific tasks, each achieved by different modes of learning. As toddlers, we might be taught the alphabet from our parents or a teacher, we might learn to walk through trial-and-error, and learn that all green foods taste gross. We take in the world through our senses, understand what things mean to us, and learn from these experiences.

AI is similar. It experiences the world using data and algorithms. Algorithms are clear rules or formulas for solving a problem. These experiences are represented by the data that is fed to the AI. The AI “thinks” about these experiences through algorithms we provide. 

#### AI in context

Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant, these are our digital companions. Those of us who are familiar with them know they have an ever-growing list of functionality: setting reminders, playing our favorite music, asking about the weather, and doing pesky unit conversion. The answers to the million-plus off-the-wall questions — each with many ways to ask — weren't programmed into these machines. These AI are trained to associate certain phrases with certain tasks. 

Also, just about anytime you're recommended something online — on Amazon, YouTube, Netflix, Pandora — you're probably experiencing AI. Through a combination of shows that you've watched before, by similar genre, sub-genre, director, starring actors, etc., what you've rated well or poorly, and what people with viewing habits similar to yours have also watched and liked, the AI chooses what it thinks is the best pick.

Other applications include, but are not limited to, Watson Jeopardy, predicting the stock market, smart thermostats, spam detection, speech to text, and most chatbots.

As you may have figured out by now, "artificial intelligence" is an enormous catchall term. 


# Why use AI?

AI can achieve higher quality outcomes faster than humanly possible. 

These systems are meant to augment our own intelligence and maximize our confidence. Today, AI is most often used to recognize patterns, make predictions, and provide insights previously out of reach due to the sheer amount of available data. The key distinction from earlier technological paradigms is that it's capable of all of this when given examples instead of instructions. 

In a growing number of fields, AI is serving as a companion for professionals to enhance performance and reduce the time required to become an expert. It will aid in the pursuit of knowledge, to further our expertise, and to improve the human condition. 

#### Specifically, why AI
AI is a powerful toolbox that has many applications in domains far and wide. The types of problems that the AI toolbox is best equipped to solve can be split into six core intents:
 - Accelerate research and discovery
 - Enrich your interactions
 - Anticipate and preempt disruptions
 - Recommend with confidence
 - Scale expertise and learning
 - Detect liabilities and mitigate risk
You can read more about these intents on the Watson website.

# How does AI work?
Data is the fuel for artificial intelligence (AI). It also takes many forms. It is the music we hear, videos we watch, weather conditions, user profiles we create. Before taking the AI plunge, you need to have the right data, and enough of it.

#### The process
The specifics will vary given the algorithm(s) chosen, but the essence remains the same. The AI does three things with the data:

 - understands the important details of the incoming experiences
 - reasons through problems it hasn't seen before
 - learns from these experiences

Feeding data to your AI is called ingestion. Once data is ingested, sometimes humans train the AI to understand the basic patterns we understand. After it’s trained and is ready to use, it's called a model. 

#### The specifics
There are many different types of AI. Some helpful people at MIT created a flowchart that guides you through whether or not the thing you're looking at is, in fact, AI. Implicitly, it goes through some of the common tasks AI performs and some of the subfields of this umbrella term, including:

 - Extracting information from pictures (computer vision)
 - Transcribing or understanding spoken words (speech to text and natural language processing)
 - Pulling insights and patterns out of written text (natural language understanding)
 - Speaking what's been written (text to speech, natural language processing)
 - Autonomously moving through spaces based on its senses (robotics)
 - Generally looking for patterns in heaps of data  (machine learning)
