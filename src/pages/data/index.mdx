  Now that machines, powered by analytics and cognitive capabilities, can technically understand, reason, learn and interact using natural language, what will they say when designers give them a voice?

## Data is important, even for you
If you're like the seven plus billion people on the planet, you make decisions. Some of these decisions you make so instinctively that you don't even realize them happening: what to wear to work, what to make for dinner, which way to take to work. Others you might agonize over before settling on a compromise: which city to move you and your family to, which job to take, which house to buy (and for how much).



If you're like the seven plus billion people on the planet, this was written for people like you.


Given the data available to us as authors, we could also hypothesize that you develop, design, sell, research, architect, etc. products or services for people. Whether you have one these responsibilities or not, you're making decisions everyday based on information you gather and patterns that have become so common that they're embedded into your intuition. This material nods to, but does not rely on, that assumption; the promise of this guide is to help you, the likely technical person, to increase your ability to productively use data to inform your design decisions to make better experiences.


Despite this, data is often talked about in exclusive (and, let's be real, mathy) language and is shrouded in mystery, leaving one of the most powerful tools in the hands of few. By its end, this material should begin to demystify the world of data, and leave you with tangible ways to begin using data for your own gain.
