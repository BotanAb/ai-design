### AI designers and developers are responsible for considering AI design, development, decision processes, and outcomes. Human judgment plays a role throughout a seemingly objective system of logical decisions. It is humans who write algorithms, who define success or failure, who make decisions about the uses of systems and who may be affected by a system’s outcomes.

### Every person involved in the creation of AI at any step is accountable for considering the system’s impact in the world, as are the companies invested in its development.

Allow for questions. A user should be able to ask why an AI is doing what it's doing on an ongoing basis. This should be clear and up front in the user interface at all times

## To consider

 - If you need somewhere to start, consider IBM’s Standards of Corporate Responsibility12 or use your company’s standards documentation.
 - Values are subjective and differ globally. Global companies must take into account language barriers and cultural differences.
 - Well-meaning values can create unintended consequences. e.g. a tailored political newsfeed provides users with news that aligns with their beliefs but does not holistically represent the gestalt.

<Aside>

_“Nearly 50% of the surveyed developers believe that the humans creating AI should be responsible for considering the ramifications of the technology. Not the bosses. Not the middle managers. The coders.”_

<Row className="questions">
<Column colMd={6} colLg={7}>

## Questions to ask your team

 - Which group’s values are expressed by our AI and why?
 - How do we agree on which values to consider as a team? (For more reading on moral alignment, check here)
 - How do we change or adjust the values reflected by our AI as our values evolve over time?


</Column>

<Row className="example">
<Column colMd={6} colLg={7}>

## Accountability example

 - The team understands that for a voice-activated assistant to work properly, it must be “always listening” for a wake word. The team makes it clear to guests that the AI hotel assistant is designed to not keep any data, or monitor guests, in both cases without their knowledge, even if it is listening for a wake word.
 - The audio collected while listening for a wake word is auto-deleted every 5 seconds. Even if a guest opts in, the AI does not actively listen in on guests unless it is called upon.
 - The team knows that this agent will be used in hotels across the world, which will require different languages and customs. They consult with linguists to ensure the AI will be able to speak in guests’ respective languages and respect applicable customs.
