## AI must be designed to protect user data and preserve the user’s power over access and uses.
It is your team's responsibility to keep users empowered with
control over their interactions.

<a href="www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/21/the-state-of-privacy-in-america/">Pew Research</a>
recently found that being in control of our own information is
“very important” to 74% of Americans.
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eprivacy-consultations-show-confidentiality-communications-and- challenge-new-technologies-are">
The European Commission20</a> found that 71% of EU citizens find
it unacceptable for companies to share information about them
without their permission. These percentages will rise as AI is
further used to either amplify our privacy or undermine it. Your
company should be fully compliant with the applicable portions of
EU’s
<a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">
General Data Protection Regulation</a> and any comparable
regulations in other countries, to make sure users understand that
AI is working in their best interests.

#### Recommended actions to take

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

01

Users should always maintain control over what data is being
used and in what context. They can deny access to personal data
that they may find compromising or unfit for an AI to know or
use.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

02

Allow users to deny service or data by having the AI ask for
permission before an interaction or providing the option during
an interaction. Privacy settings and permissions should be
clear, findable, and adjustable.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

03

Provide full disclosure on how the personal information is being
used or shared.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

04

Users' data should be protected from theft, misuse, or data
corruption.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

05

Forbid use of another company's data without permission when
creating a new AI service.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

06

Recognize and adhere to applicable
<a href="http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/InternationalLaw.aspx">
national and international rights laws</a> when designing for an AI’s
acceptable user data access permissions.

### Nearly 50% of the surveyed developers believe that the humans creating AI should be responsible for considering the ramifications of the technology. Not the bosses. Not the middle managers. The coders.

<Row className="hr consider">
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

#### To consider

 - Employ security practices including encryption, access control
 methodologies, and proprietary consent management modules to
 restrict access to authorized users and to de-identify data in
 accordance with user preferences.
 - It is your responsibility to work with your team to address any
 lack of these practices.


</Column>
</Row>



<Row className="hr questions">
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

#### Questions to ask your team

 - What types of sensitive personal datadoes the AI utilize and
 how will this data be protected?
 - What contractual agreements are necessary for data usage and
 what are the local and international laws that are applicable
 to our AI?
 - How do we create the best user experience with the minimum
 amount of required user data?

<Row className="hr example">
<Column colMd={6} colLg={8}>

#### User data rights example

 - The hotel provides guests with a consent agreement to utilize
 the AI hotel assistant before they begin using the AI’s
 services. This agreement clearly outlines to guests that the
 hotel does not own their data and they have the right to purge
 this data from the system at any time, even after checkout.
 - During user interviews, the design researchers find that the
 guests feel they should be provided with a summary of the
 information that was acquired from them during their stay. At
 checkout, they can instruct the hotel to remove this information
 from the system if they wish.
