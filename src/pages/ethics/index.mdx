<PageDescription>
  This document represents the beginning of a conversation defining Everyday Ethics for AI. Ethics must be embedded into the design and development process from the very beginning of AI creation.
  <br/><br/>This is meant to stimulate ideas and provoke thought. The idea here is to start simple and iterate. Rather than strive for perfection first, we’re releasing this to allow all who read and use this to comment, critique and participate in all future iterations. So please experiment, play, use, and break what you find here and send us your feedback. Designers and developers of AI systems are encouraged to be aware of these concepts and seize opportunities to intentionally put these ideas into practice.
  <br/><br/>As you work with your team and others, please share this guide with them. If you have questions, comments or suggestions please email edethics@us.ibm.com to contribute to this effort.

# Introduction

### Ethical decision-making is not just another form of technical problem solving.
As AI designers and developers, we hold a vast share of the collective influence. We are creating systems that will impact millions of people.
Artificial intelligence technology is rapidly growing in capability, impact and influence. As designers and developers of AI systems, it is an imperative to understand the ethical considerations of our work.
A tech-centric focus that solely revolves around improving the capabilities of an intelligent system doesn't sufficiently consider human needs.

An ethical, human-centric AI must be designed and developed in a manner that is aligned with the values and ethical principles of a society or the community it affects.
Ethics is based on well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues (Markkula Center for Applied Ethics 1).

### This guide provides discussion points concerning:
 - specific virtues that AI systems should possess;
 - guidance for designers and developers building and training AI.

To create and foster trust between humans and machines, you must understand the ethical resources and standards available for reference during the designing, building, and maintenance of AI.
The large-scale focus on AI ethics by groups like the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems2, which will be referenced throughout this document, should be mirrored in businesses and working groups of all sizes.
The criteria and metrics for ethical AI systems will ultimately depend on the industry and use case they operate within. We hope this document serves as a central source that helps teams establish best practices.
Designers and developers should never work in a vacuum and must stay in tune with users’ needs and concerns.
Constant improvement and assessment is key to ensuring that design and development teams address users’ concerns. This document provides teams with a starting point and will surely evolve as AI capabilities continue to grow.



 # Closing
 Designers and developers of AI can help mitigate bias and
 disenfranchisement by practicing within these five areas of
 ethical considerations. AI systems must remain flexible enough to
 undergo constant maintenance and improvement as ethical challenges
 are discovered and remediated.

 By adopting and practicing the five focal areas covered in this
 document, designers and developers can become more ethically
 aware, mitigate biases within these systems, and instill
 responsibility and accountability in those who work with AI.

 As much of what we do related to artificial intelligence is new
 territory for all of us, individuals and groups will need to
 further define criteria and metrics for evaluation to better allow
 for the detection and mitigation of any issues.

 This is an ongoing project: <span className="ibm-type-semibold">we
 welcome and encourage feedback so the guide can develop and mature
 over time</span>. We hope it contributes to the dialogue and
 debate about the implications of these technologies for humanity
 and allows designers and developers to embed ethics into the AI
 solutions they work on.
