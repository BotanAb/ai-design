<PageDescription>

  We’ve built our perspective on ethical AI design through conversations with our subject matter experts, our teams, our stakeholders, and by referencing publicly available material. The resources below offer additional context on our foundational knowledge and insight into how these directions will continue to evolve in the future.

## Overview

<Row>
<Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

Ethical decision-making isn’t just another form of technical problem solving. As designers and developers of AI systems, we hold a vast share of the collective influence and it is an imperative to understand the ethical considerations of our work. We are creating systems that will impact millions of people.

> "An ethical, human-centric AI must be designed and developed in a manner that is aligned with the values and ethical principles of a society or the community it affects. Ethics is based on well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues."

We’ll add content and resources to this section of the site over time as we incorporate them into our design practice. Our goal here is transparency around what works for us and our users, and why.
